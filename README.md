Syntax highlighting for Spring roo and JSPX files in the PSPad editor

PSPad allows to use custom syntax highlighting for specific text files that you can modify in Spring ROO.

I concentrate on the GVNix version of Spring ROO. (see  http://www.gvnix.org/en/ and http://projects.spring.io/spring-roo/)

The following files enhance the editing of Spring Roo script files (.roo) and the tagx and jspx files.


Copy the ```Roo.ini``` and the ```tagx.ini``` files from the ```Syntax\``` directory to the ```Syntax``` subdirectory where PSPad was installed on your PC.
By default on Windows7 this is ```C:\Program Files (x86)\PSPad editor\```
