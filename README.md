Syntax highlighting for Spring roo and JSPX files in the PSPad editor (http://www.pspad.com/)

PSPad allows to use custom syntax highlighting for specific text files that you can modify in Spring ROO.

The focus is on the GVNix version of Spring ROO. (see  http://www.gvnix.org/en/ and http://projects.spring.io/spring-roo/)

The following files enhance the editing of Spring Roo script files (with a .roo extension) and the tagx and jspx files which our XML/XHTML files.


Copy the ```Roo.ini``` and the ```tagx.ini``` files from the ```Syntax\``` directory to the ```Syntax``` subdirectory where PSPad was installed on your PC.
By default on Windows7 this is ```C:\Program Files (x86)\PSPad editor\```

Start PSPad

If you have not yet enabled the ```Multi User Environment```, then please first enable it with 
```Settings Menu | Program Settings | Systems Integration```. This ensures that the settings are stored per user in a PSPad.ini file.. If this was not set before, please close PSPad and start it up again so that it takes into account this new setting.

Start PSPad

Open ```Settings Menu | Users Higlighters  Settings``` and click on the topmost (out of ten possible) ```<not assigned>``` items in.the left pane. In the right hand pane, select now the ```Spring Roo``` ini file. If it does not appear in the list, please exit and restart PSPad once more.
