Syntax highlighting for Spring roo and JSPX files in the PSPad editor

PSPad allows to use custom syntax highlighting for specific text files that you can modify in Spring ROO.

The focus is on the GVNix version of Spring ROO. (see  http://www.gvnix.org/en/ and http://projects.spring.io/spring-roo/)

The following files enhance the editing of Spring Roo script files (with a .roo extension) and the tagx and jspx files which our XML/XHTML files.


Copy the ```Roo.ini``` and the ```tagx.ini``` files from the ```Syntax\``` directory to the ```Syntax``` subdirectory where PSPad was installed on your PC.
By default on Windows7 this is ```C:\Program Files (x86)\PSPad editor\```
